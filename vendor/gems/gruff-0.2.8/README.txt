== Gruff Graphs

A library for making beautiful graphs.

See samples at http://nubyonrails.com/pages/gruff

See the test suite in test/line_test.rb for examples.

== Documentation

Most of the documentation is in the Gruff::Base class.

== WARNING

This is beta-quality software. It works well according to my tests, but the API may change and other features will be added.
